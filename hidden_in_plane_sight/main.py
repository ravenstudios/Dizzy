"""
    For todays adventure we are going to work on list index.
    The index is the location in the list where an item is held.
    Lets say we have a list, l = ["d", "0", "G"]
    If we want "0" we would use l[1] because starting from zero, the "0" is in index 1.
    Strings can be used the same way.
    s = "lama farts"
    s[0] would = "l"
    s[8] would = "t"
    s[4] would = " "

    So what we need to do is loop throug the song list below
    and use each number as the index for the letter needed from lyrics.
    Make a empty string variable, and append each letter, then print to find the message.

    Who does she think she is, that girl has tangled with
    The wrong man! No one says no to Gaston

    Dismissed! Rejected, publicly humiliated

    More beer
    What for? Nothing helps, I'm disgraced
    Who, you, never Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
