Hello Beautiful. Below you will find a secret message.
Your mission is to decode this message and text me
the name of the album and artist.

Since this is the first one we will take it easy.
All you have to do is reverse the secret_message string below.

But as you get better I will make these
secret messages harder. ;) inseret joke here_____________


I associate music with memories in my life. There are
some songs I cant listen to because it hurts too much.
Some songs, band, albums make me feel happy. There is
an album that I've always loved and it always makes me happy.
I got this album around the time we were togather. Im not
sure if I every played it for you. This album is a mix of emotions
and some lyrics of some songs hits home and REALLY makes me think of you.
If you get a chance, please listen to this album and think of me. But only
the good lyrics.
