Hello Beautiful, I want to tell you something important. But I dont want
anybody else to know, so I made another secret message just for you.
To understand the message you need to loop through the list
below and call chr() for every item in this list
and append each item converted into a char into a variable
you can print out to find the message im trying to tell you.

These are ascii numbers that repersent letters and symbols.
This is how a computer uses letters

I.E.

Lets say we have a list with numbes [72, 105]
If you look at the ascii table you can see that 72 = "H" and 105 = "i"

HINT: you will need a variable to hold each letter I.E. result = "",
then result += each item you call chr() on.

Listen, no fucking cheating this time. I put my heart into
thing of what song I want you to listen to and know the message
I'm trying to tell you.
If you cheat this time you'll get a good spanking.

song = [104, 116, 116, 112, 115, 58, 47, 47, 119, 119, 119, 46, 121, 111, 117, 116, 117, 98, 101, 46, 99, 111, 109, 47, 119, 97, 116, 99, 104, 63, 118, 61, 115, 118, 121, 76, 77, 82, 55, 121, 106, 104, 85, 53]
